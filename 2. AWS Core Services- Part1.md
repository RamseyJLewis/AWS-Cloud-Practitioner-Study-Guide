# What are we going to cover:{

* Simple Storage Service -  storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.

* Amazon Glacier - are a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost Amazon S3 cloud storage classes for data archiving and long-term backup.

* Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) -  is a service that lets you launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you define.

* Elastic Compute Cloud - is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

* Elastic Block Storage - is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

* Costing Aspects - an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.}


# AWS SIMPLE STORAGE SERVICE :{

An example of a Amazon Simple Storage Service use case is say you have an application that allows users to upload photos you can use the AWS Simple Storage Service to store those photos
	
Features of AWS Simple Storage Service:

- Scales Automatically 
- Practically give you an unlimited amount of storage
- Highly reliable
- Copies of object are made in different locations
- Versoning:  have versioning in place for changes to objects.
- S4 bucket behaving as a static website.
- Cross Region Replication: This is when you want to ensure objects are available in another region

	* Storage Classes:

* Standard Storage Class: This is the  default class. This is used if objects in the bucket are accessed frequently

* Reduced Redundancy Storage Class: Designed to store non-critical data. If you want to lower cost for storage, but dont mind reduced SLA.

* STANDARD_IA and ONEZONE-IA:  This for infrequently accessed objects.

* GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE: Used for data archival. Storage at much lower cost. 

            How Does It Work:
                                    |===== Object (img, ect)
            Simple Storage Service ====>  Bucket   <========= Object
                                    |===== Object
    }

    # AWS AMAZON GLACIER: {

* Use case is that Amazon Glacier is good for storing data for longer periods of time
    - Used for cold or archive storage 
    - Much cheaper storage option

* How does it work?
    - In AWS Console you create a vault to hold objects
    - In order to upload an object you need to use the AWS CLI or AWS SDK
    - OR you can use the Lifecycle  management feature in S3


		* EXAMPLE OF LIFECYCLE

- SIMPLE STORAGE SERVICE ===(1 WEEK OLD OBJECT)===> AMAZON GLACIER 

    - In order to retrieve an object you have to submit a job request.
    - With the standard retrieval, it could take 3-5 hours to download an object.
    - It's cheaper but takes way longer to move around
You also have expedited retrieval at a higher cost to retrieve an object within a matter of minutes
} 


# AWS VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD {

Allows you to have an isolated virtual network dedicated to your AWS account
Its is isolated from other virtual networks
You can launch resources such as EC2(Virtual Servers)

* How does it work:
    - In AWS, you can define a Virtual Private Cloud.
    - The VPX will be allocated a CIDR block(eg.10.0.0/16)
    - You can have multiple VPC’s defined in AWS
    - For example for a different branches of a company or different personal projects
    - When you create an AWS account, you get a default VPC created per region.
    In your VPC you can define subnets
    - The subnet will be assigned a CIDR block which is a subnet of the CIDR block of the VPC.

    # IMPORTANT!                     
    (If you don't come from a networking background IT IS NOT REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND NETWORKING FULLY for the Cloud Practitioner Exam just understand the basics. The VPC is your private virtual network on AWS)

		|-----VPC-------------|
