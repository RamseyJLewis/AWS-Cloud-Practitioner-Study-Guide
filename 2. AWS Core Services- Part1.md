# What are we going to cover:{

* Simple Storage Service -  storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.

* Amazon Glacier - are a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost Amazon S3 cloud storage classes for data archiving and long-term backup.

* Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) -  is a service that lets you launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you define.

* Elastic Compute Cloud - is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

* Elastic Block Storage - is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

* Costing Aspects - an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.}


# AWS SIMPLE STORAGE SERVICE :{

An example of a Amazon Simple Storage Service use case is say you have an application that allows users to upload photos you can use the AWS Simple Storage Service to store those photos
	
Features of AWS Simple Storage Service:

- Scales Automatically 
- Practically give you an unlimited amount of storage
- Highly reliable
- Copies of object are made in different locations
- Versoning:  have versioning in place for changes to objects.
- S4 bucket behaving as a static website.
- Cross Region Replication: This is when you want to ensure objects are available in another region

	* Storage Classes:

* Standard Storage Class: This is the  default class. This is used if objects in the bucket are accessed frequently

* Reduced Redundancy Storage Class: Designed to store non-critical data. If you want to lower cost for storage, but dont mind reduced SLA.

* STANDARD_IA and ONEZONE-IA:  This for infrequently accessed objects.

* GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE: Used for data archival. Storage at much lower cost. 

            How Does It Work:
                                    |===== Object (img, ect)
            Simple Storage Service ====>  Bucket   <========= Object
                                    |===== Object
    }
