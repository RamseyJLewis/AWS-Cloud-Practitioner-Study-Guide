# What are we going to cover?:{

* AWS Lambda - a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you. You can use AWS Lambda to extend other AWS services with custom logic, or create your own back-end services that operate at AWS scale, performance, and security.

* AWS Elastic Beanstalk - AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, . NET, PHP, Node. js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.

* Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) - a pay-per-use web service for storing messages in transit between computers. Developers use SQS to build distributed applications with decoupled components without having to deal with the overhead of creating and maintaining message queues.

* Simple Notification Service -(Amazon SNS) is a fully managed messaging service for both application-to-application (A2A) and application-to-person (A2P) communication. The A2P functionality enables you to send messages to users at scale via SMS, mobile push, and email.

* Cloudfront - a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment.

# AWS-Lambda.md {

* A quick understanding 
	- Serverless compute service available through AWS
	- Here you don’t need to maintain the infrastructure
	- Supports a host of programming languages such as Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, Go, .Net
	- Can only run a site for a max size of 3gb and for a max time of 15 minutes

* A Deeper Understanding
	- Its like an ec2 instance yes you can host code just like an EC2 instance
	- On an EC2 instance your code is posted and stays and you pay for it actively
	- The other option is to deploy on AWS Lambda 
	- AWS Lambda manages most things for you like security of your website
	- You can pause it and start it and aws will only charge you when you start it

* What to consider
	- This service is completely managed for you so you won't have access to security which can be bad for some use cases
	- The maximum amount of memory is 3gb and the site can only run for 15 minutes
