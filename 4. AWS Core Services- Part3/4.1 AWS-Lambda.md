# AWS-Lambda.md {

* A quick understanding 
	- Serverless compute service available through AWS
	- Here you donâ€™t need to maintain the infrastructure
	- Supports a host of programming languages such as Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, Go, .Net
	- Can only run a site for a max size of 3gb and for a max time of 15 minutes

* A Deeper Understanding
	- Its like an ec2 instance yes you can host code just like an EC2 instance
	- On an EC2 instance your code is posted and stays and you pay for it actively
	- The other option is to deploy on AWS Lambda 
	- AWS Lambda manages most things for you like security of your website
	- You can pause it and start it and aws will only charge you when you start it

* What to consider
	- This service is completely managed for you so you won't have access to security which can be bad for some use cases
	- The maximum amount of memory is 3gb and the site can only run for 15 minutes
