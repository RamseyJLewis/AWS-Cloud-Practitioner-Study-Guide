# What are we going to cover?: {

* Elastic Load Balancer:  a load-balancing service for Amazon Web Services (AWS) deployments. ELB automatically distributes incoming application traffic and scales resources to meet traffic demands. ELB helps an IT team adjust capacity according to incoming application and network traffic.

* Route53: a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It is designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and cost effective way to route end users to Internet applications by translating names like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.

* Amazon Cloudfront :  is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment.

* Relational Database service (RDS):  a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the AWS Cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks.

* Dyanmo DB: an Amazon Web Services database system that supports data structures and key-valued cloud services. It allows users the benefit of auto-scaling, in-memory caching, backup and restore options for all their internet-scale applications using DynamoDB.

# AWS Elastic Load Balancer Service{

* Quick Understanding: 
    - Distributes requests to underlying EC2 Instances.
    - The Elastic Load Balancer is a managed service
    - There are different types of Load Balancers in aws

* How it works / A User Case
	
    - Lets say you have an  ecommerce application with a lot of traffic coming due to a sale promotion. 

    - Your EC2 is running at 80% of 4CPU  making your page run slower for clients losing sales. 

    - To combat this you COULD change to a higher instance type of 8 CPU BUT that could cause software problems. 

    - What the Elastic Load Balancer does is it creates multiple of an EC2 instance and split users between the two for a single Web Application.

# Route 53{

* Quick Understanding
    - Register domain names.
    - Route traffic to resources hosted in AWS.
    - check the health of your resources.

* How it works / Use Case

    - Routes a .com .org ect domain through to an EC2 hosted website

    - Step : Create a hosted zone - website.com  (you can buy externally)

    - Step 2: Register the Name Server in the domain registrar

    - Step 3: Create a resources record in hosted zone

* Routing Policies

	- Simple Routing Policy: Used for a single resources
	- Failover Routing Policy: Used for active passive failover
	- Geolocation Routing Policy: Route traffic based on location to users 
	- Weighted Routing Policy: Route traffic to different resources based on weightage.
	- Latency Routing Policy:  Route traffic to the region that provides the best latency


*   Helpful things to know
    
    - In AWS Route 53 you can purchase your own domain name but It’ll probably cost more than if you bought one from an external provider, I use namecheap.com
